# Decision-making-statements-using-loops

## Theory:

In C++, decision making and looping are fundamental control structures that help in controlling the flow of the program based on certain conditions.

**1. Decision Making Statements** : 
These statements are used to execute a particular block of code based on the evaluation of conditions.

**-If Statement**: Executes a block of code if a specified condition is true.

**-If-else Statement**: Executes one block if the condition is true, another if it's false.

**-Else-if Ladder**: Used to check multiple conditions.

**-Switch Statement**: Selects one of many blocks of code to be executed.

**2. Looping Statements** :
Loops are used to execute a block of code repeatedly based on a condition.

**-For Loop** : Used when the number of iterations is known.

**-While Loop** : Checks condition before executing the loop body.

**-Do while Loop** : Executes the loop body at least once, then checks the condition.
